# Health Management Data Analysis Dashboard - Power BI

This project analyzes health management data from a hospital using Power BI to derive valuable insights. The dashboard includes multiple visualizations focused on hospital operations, patient diagnostics, and billing, designed to aid in better decision-making. Below are the key features of the dashboard:

## Key Features:
1. **Patient Information**: Displays admission, discharge, and follow-up dates, alongside the billing amount for each patient.
2. **Bed Occupancy**: Visualizes the bed occupancy by different wards (Private, General, ICU), providing an overview of hospital resource usage.
3. **Doctor’s Feedback**: A pie chart that illustrates feedback provided by different doctors, offering insights into patient care and physician involvement.
4. **Diagnosis Type**: A bar chart highlighting the types of diagnoses such as viral infections, flu, malaria, typhoid, and more, along with the total count of patients.
5. **Insurance and Billing Analysis**: Compares the count of health insurance amounts against the sum of billing amounts for various diagnosis categories.
6. **Tests Conducted**: A pie chart detailing the proportion of tests conducted (Blood Test, MRI, CT Scan, Ultrasound, X-Ray), offering insights into the hospital’s diagnostic services.

## Technologies Used:
- Power BI for data visualization and reporting.
- Health management dataset for insights into hospital operations and patient outcomes.

## Insights Derived:
- Understanding trends in diagnosis types and hospital resources such as bed occupancy.
- Analysis of healthcare billing and insurance coverage to optimize financial management.
- Doctor feedback visualization helps in assessing service quality.
- Test analysis provides insights into diagnostic trends and hospital services usage.

This project demonstrates how data-driven insights can be used to improve healthcare management and decision-making.
